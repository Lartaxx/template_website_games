># Configuration file
The configuration file will allow you to put the data of your server 

```php
<?php

define("type", "gmod"); // You have all servers here https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ/tree/v3/src/GameQ/Protocols
define("host", "51.38.243.116"); // The host of your server (without the port!)
define("port", "27310"); // The port of your server

?>
```

> # Server open / closed
I created a condition of a variable to know if your server is open or closed.

Here are the images of the rendering :point_down: 

### Server open :
